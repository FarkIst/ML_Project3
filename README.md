### Part 0: Business Case 

* One of the business cases we came up with, would be some form of salesman from a company. As a business person from a company talks to clients in order to sell a product. Based on their conversation and the recipients frequency and change of frequency & emotion in their voice, we could determine whether the person is resillient to make a purchase if we run the recipients voice-recording through an Machine Learning Algorithm after the call/conversation. 

* Another business case would be to a gender related study. This could be a survey at work or any form of research/information gathering organization. This could forexample be used in Politics to determine the %-rates of Male & Female "voice/speech"-participation during fx. A Parliament meeting. 

* Third and last business case for our project would be an unethical study to detect "un-closeted"-"closet-dudes". This would require to actually find a "dude" that meets the above-mentioned requirements and train our model based on, without them knowing that we're recording their voice. The "dude" based to train the model on would play a crucial role, so we don't encounter a false positive. Overall this would help us determine if people that haven't "un-closeted" themselves, actually is still in the "closet", without them knowing. The "stealth factor" in this approach would help to bring in the best results.
